# :uk: Solution :uk:
Vulnerablity lays in
``` c
  fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
  char *end = strchr(name, '\n');
  if (end != NULL) {
    *end = '\x00';
  }

  strcat(name, ",\nPlease Enter the Password.");
```

We have a buffer of 256 bytes for `name`, and then the string will be concatenated, this way, if we put more than 228 bytes, those 27 bytes will be added and replaced the termination string, inside the password buffer.

This way when printed, it will print both variables.
