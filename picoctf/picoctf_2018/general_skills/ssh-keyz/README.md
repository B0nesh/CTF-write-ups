As nice as it is to use our webshell, sometimes its helpful to connect directly to our machine. To do so, please add your own public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, using the webshell. The flag is in the ssh banner which will be displayed when you login remotely with ssh to with your username.

###### We don't even have to add our own public key to the authorized_keys, it's a bug they have, I don't think it's working as intended, but if you ssh straight into their server, it lets you in, without typing anything else than your pass.
###### And even gives you the flag before logging into the server successfully.

###### No tenemos ni que a침adir nuestra public key al authorized_keys, supongo que ser치 un bug, pero no tienes ni que a침adir tu public key para entrar a su servidor, ni hace falta logearnos con nuestra password, ya que nos dan la flag simplemente con el request de SSH.
