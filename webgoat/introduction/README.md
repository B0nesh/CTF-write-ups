# WebGoat
A greeting from the WebGoat team.
# WebWolf
They introduce us to WebWolf, their new tool which acts as a web application which simulates an attacker machine.

They ask us to send an email to our WebWolf domain, and enter the unique code we receive.

Also, they ask us to click a fake link to our attackers machine and enter the parameter we receive.
